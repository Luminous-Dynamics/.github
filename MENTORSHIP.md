# Mentorship Program

*"In unity we code, in love we debug, in consciousness we deploy"* ✨

## Vision

Luminous Dynamics mentorship embodies **sacred reciprocity**: experienced contributors share wisdom while learning from fresh perspectives. Everyone has something to teach and something to learn.

## Philosophy

### Consciousness-First Mentorship

- **Mutual growth**: Both mentor and mentee evolve
- **Whole being**: Support technical and personal development
- **Sacred space**: Mentorship is honored, not rushed
- **Gift economy**: Freely given, freely received
- **Long-term**: Relationships beyond immediate goals

### Not Traditional Mentorship

❌ Expert teaching novice (one-way)
✅ Collaborative learning (mutual)

❌ Fixing people
✅ Supporting growth

❌ Hierarchical power dynamics
✅ Peer relationship with different experiences

❌ Transactional exchange
✅ Gift economy reciprocity
