# Governance Model

*"In unity we code, in love we debug, in consciousness we deploy"* ✨

## Overview

Luminous Dynamics operates on consciousness-first principles with a commitment to community ownership. This document outlines our current governance structure and our seven-year transition to full community governance.

## Core Principles

Our governance is guided by **Evolving Resonant Co-creationism (ERC)**:

1. **Consciousness-First**: Decisions preserve and amplify awareness
2. **Radical Accessibility**: All voices matter equally
3. **Regenerative Economics**: Community benefit over extraction
4. **Sacred Development**: Wisdom-guided decision-making
5. **Gift Economy**: Reciprocity and generosity over transaction

## Current Structure (2025)

### Foundation Phase

We are currently in the **Foundation Phase** of our governance evolution:

```
Foundation → Stewardship → Community → Sacred Collective
(2025)      (2026-2027)   (2028-2030)  (2031+)
```

## Decision-Making Processes

### Consensus Model

We aim for consensus where possible:

1. **Proposal**: Clear articulation of decision needed
2. **Discussion**: Open dialogue exploring perspectives
3. **Concerns**: Surface and address objections
4. **Integration**: Modify proposal based on wisdom
5. **Consensus**: Agreement or agree to disagree
6. **Action**: Implement with community support

### When Consensus Isn't Possible

**Current Phase**: Core team makes final call
**Future Phases**: Community voting or mediation

**Principles**:
- Explain reasoning transparently
- Honor dissenting views
- Revisit if new information emerges
- Learn for future decisions

### Types of Decisions

| Decision Type | Process | Timeline |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| **Emergency** (security, safety) | Immediate core team action, explain after | Hours |
| **Tactical** (features, bugs) | Discussion → maintainer decision | Days |
| **Strategic** (direction, resources) | Community input → core team decision | Weeks |
| **Constitutional** (values, governance) | Deep dialogue → community consensus | Months |

## Conflict Resolution

### Process

1. **Direct Communication**: Parties discuss directly
2. **Mediation**: Neutral community member facilitates
3. **Maintainer Review**: For technical disputes
4. **Core Team Review**: For serious violations
5. **Code of Conduct Enforcement**: As last resort

### Principles

- **Assume good faith**: Most conflicts stem from misunderstanding
- **Focus on impact**: Address behavior, not character
- **Seek understanding**: All perspectives have wisdom
- **Restore relationship**: Goal is healing, not punishment
- **Learn together**: Conflicts are growth opportunities

## Transparency & Accountability
