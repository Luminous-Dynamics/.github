# Sustainability & Funding Model

*"In unity we code, in love we debug, in consciousness we deploy"* ✨

## 🌱 Our Approach to Sustainability

Luminous Dynamics operates on **gift economy principles** with a **seven-year transition to full community ownership**. This document outlines how we sustain our work while honoring ERC values.

## 💚 Core Principles

### 1. Gift Economy Over Extraction
We receive contributions as gifts and offer our work as gifts. Financial support is voluntary, not extractive.

### 2. Regenerative Over Exploitative
We build systems that restore and enhance rather than deplete. Our funding model must align with this.

### 3. Community Ownership
We transition from founder-led to community-governed over seven years, ensuring long-term mission alignment.

### 4. Transparency
All funding, expenses, and financial decisions are shared openly with the community.

### 5. Multiple Income Streams
We diversify funding to avoid dependence on any single source that might compromise our mission.
