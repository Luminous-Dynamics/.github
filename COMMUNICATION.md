## 🎯 Communication Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Radical Transparency**
   - Default to public communication
   - Share context, reasoning, and trade-offs
   - Document decisions where others can find them

2. **Async-First, Sync-When-Valuable**
   - Respect different timezones and schedules
   - Write comprehensive messages that don't require immediate response
   - Use synchronous time for high-bandwidth collaboration, not information transfer

3. **Conscious Listening**
   - Read to understand, not to respond
   - Acknowledge before disagreeing
   - Assume good intent

4. **Inclusive by Default**
   - Use clear language (avoid jargon without explanation)
   - Provide context for newcomers
   - Make space for diverse voices

5. **Sacred Reciprocity**
   - Give credit generously
   - Share knowledge freely
   - Honor the time and energy of others

## 🌍 Cross-Timezone Collaboration

### Our Global Community

Contributors span from UTC-8 (Pacific) to UTC+10 (Australia). Effective async communication is essential.

### Async-First Practices

**Write for Async Understanding:**

❌ **Sync-Dependent:**
```
"Can someone look at this?"
[link]
```

✅ **Async-Friendly:**
```
I'm implementing Byzantine fault detection for Mycelix. The current approach
(linked below) has 5ms latency, but we need <1ms for production.

I've tried:
1. Caching trust scores - improved to 3ms
2. Parallel validation - degraded to 7ms
3. Bloom filters - no improvement

Context: PR #234 (https://github.com/.../pull/234)
Related issue: #189

Question: Has anyone tackled similar latency constraints in distributed
systems? Any approaches I should explore?

I'll continue investigating compression techniques while awaiting feedback.
```

**Why Better:**
- Complete context (anyone can help, not just those who remember)
- Shows your work (easier to suggest next steps)
- Specific ask (clear how to help)
- Non-blocking (you continue working)

**Timezone-Friendly Scheduling:**

When scheduling synchronous meetings:
1. Rotate meeting times to share inconvenience
2. Provide async alternatives (input documents, recordings)
3. Use tools like [World Time Buddy](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/)
4. List times in multiple zones or UTC

Example:
```markdown
## Next Sacred Council

**Topic:** 2026 Roadmap Priorities

**Times (choose one):**
- Session A: 2025-02-15 at 16:00 UTC (8am PST / 11am EST / 5pm CET)
- Session B: 2025-02-16 at 01:00 UTC (5pm PST / 8pm EST / 10am AEDT)

**Can't attend?** Submit input via [this document](link) by Feb 14.
**Recording:** Published within 48h to Discussions.
```

### Response Time Expectations

**Your Responsibilities:**
- Acknowledge messages within expected window (even if full response takes longer)
- Set vacation/away status when unavailable
- No expectation to respond outside your working hours
- Urgent = security vulnerabilities only

**What to Expect:**
- GitHub Issues/Discussions: 2-5 days
- Pull Request reviews: 1-3 days (varies by size)
- Discord: Minutes to hours (not guaranteed)
- Email: 3-7 days

**If Time-Sensitive:**
```markdown
⏰ Time-sensitive: This needs input by Feb 15 for the grant deadline.

[Context and details...]

If you can't respond by then, no worries—I'll proceed with approach B.
```

## ✍️ Writing Effective Messages

### Async Communication Best Practices

**Provide Context:**
```markdown
Good:
"I'm working on the Terra Atlas energy forecasting module (TA-234).
The current ML model has 85% accuracy, but we need 95% for production.
I'm exploring ensemble methods. Has anyone used XGBoost for time-series
forecasting in similar domains?"

Bad:
"Has anyone used XGBoost?"
```

**Make it Scannable:**
```markdown
Good:
## Problem
MATL trust layer OOMs at 10k participants.

## What I've Tried
- Increased heap size → delayed OOM to 12k
- Pagination → broke Byzantine detection
- Compression → no significant improvement

## Question
Should I explore distributed memory (Redis) or redesign the trust aggregation?

Bad:
[Wall of text with no structure]
```

**Be Explicit About Asks:**
```markdown
Good:
"Looking for feedback on the API design by Friday. Specifically:
1. Are the parameter names clear?
2. Is the error handling sufficient?
3. Should we support callbacks or promises?"

Bad:
"Thoughts?"
```

### Disagreement and Conflict

**Productive Disagreement:**

✅ **Do:**
- Acknowledge what you agree with first
- Disagree with ideas, not people
- Propose alternatives, not just criticism
- Assume good intent
- Take heated discussions private or async

❌ **Don't:**
- Make it personal ("you always...")
- Use sarcasm (doesn't translate well)
- Dismiss without explaining
- Demand rather than request

**Example:**
```markdown
Good:
"I appreciate the thorough analysis in this proposal. The performance
benchmarks are compelling.

I'm concerned about the maintenance burden of adding another dependency.
We've had issues with unmaintained packages before (see #456).

Alternative: Could we implement a lightweight version of this functionality
ourselves? I'd estimate 200 LOC based on the spec.

Happy to discuss trade-offs in tomorrow's working session."

Bad:
"This is overengineered. We don't need another dependency."
```

### Giving Feedback

**Code Review Feedback:**

Use [Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/):
- **praise:** Highlight good work
- **nitpick:** Minor style preference (non-blocking)
- **suggestion:** Propose improvement
- **issue:** Problem that should be addressed
- **question:** Seeking clarification

Example:
```markdown
**praise:** Love the comprehensive error handling here. This will make
debugging much easier.

**suggestion:** Consider extracting this validation logic into a separate
function for reusability:
[code example]

**nitpick:** Variable name `d` could be more descriptive (`duration`?).
Not blocking, just a thought.

**question:** How does this handle the case where `participants` is empty?
```

## 🔍 Finding Information

### Before Asking

Help us help you by checking:

1. **Documentation:**
   - [README.md](./README.md) - Overview and navigation
   - [FAQ.md](./FAQ.md) - Common questions
   - [GLOSSARY.md](./GLOSSARY.md) - Terminology
   - Project-specific docs in each repository

2. **Existing Discussions:**
   - Search GitHub Issues and Discussions
   - Check Discord history (#help and relevant channels)

3. **Ask Anyway If:**
   - You searched but didn't find what you need
   - Documentation is unclear (please tell us!)
   - You want human context beyond docs

### How to Ask Good Questions

**Provide Context:**
- What are you trying to accomplish? (goal)
- What have you tried? (attempts)
- What happened? (results)
- What did you expect? (expectations)

**Example:**

❌ **Bad Question:**
```
"How do I use Mycelix?"
```

✅ **Good Question:**
```
**Goal:** I want to train a federated model for image classification across
10 mobile devices.

**What I've tried:**
1. Followed the Quick Start (got basic federation working)
2. Tried adapting the text model example to images
3. Getting error: "Tensor shape mismatch" (full error below)

**Environment:**
- Mycelix v2.1.0
- Python 3.9
- Ubuntu 20.04

**Error:**
[full traceback]

**Question:** How do I configure Mycelix for image models? Is there a
working example I can reference?
```

## 📊 Communication Anti-Patterns

### What to Avoid

❌ **Drive-By Questions:**
```
Discord: "Is anyone here?"
[waits for response before asking actual question]
```
✅ **Better:** Just ask your question with context. People will respond when available.

---

❌ **DM-First:**
```
[Sends DM to maintainer]: "Quick question about Mycelix..."
```
✅ **Better:** Ask publicly (Issues/Discussions/Discord). Benefits everyone, gets faster response.

---

❌ **XY Problem:**
```
"How do I parse XML in Python?"
[Actual problem: trying to configure a YAML file]
```
✅ **Better:** Describe your actual goal, not just the solution you've assumed.

---

❌ **No-Context Links:**
```
"Thoughts?"
[link to 500-line PR]
```
✅ **Better:** "I've refactored the trust layer for better performance (PR #234). Specifically looking for feedback on the caching strategy in commit abc123."

---

❌ **Thread Hijacking:**
```
[In GitHub Issue about performance bug]
"Hey while we're here, can we also add dark mode?"
```
✅ **Better:** Open a separate issue. Keep discussions focused.
