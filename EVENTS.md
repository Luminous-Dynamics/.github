## 🎯 Event Philosophy

### Why Events Matter

**Events create:**
- **Connection** - Meet the humans behind GitHub avatars
- **Learning** - Share knowledge through workshops and talks
- **Collaboration** - Pair programming, hackathons, co-creation
- **Celebration** - Recognize achievements and milestones
- **Belonging** - Strengthen sense of community

### Core Principles

1. **Inclusive by Design**
   - Accessible venues and virtual options
   - Diverse speakers and participants
   - Welcoming to all skill levels
   - Multiple participation modes

2. **Conscious Hosting**
   - Code of Conduct enforced
   - Psychological safety prioritized
   - Sustainable practices (minimal waste)
   - Care for hosts and attendees

3. **Value Over Scale**
   - 10 engaged people > 100 passive attendees
   - Deep connection > broad reach
   - Quality experience > big numbers

4. **Hybrid When Possible**
   - In-person for deep connection
   - Virtual for accessibility and reach
   - Recorded for those who can't attend
   - Documentation for all

## 🎤 Running Great Events

### Opening Well

**First 10 Minutes Set the Tone:**

1. **Welcome** - Warmly greet everyone
2. **Land Acknowledgment** - Honor indigenous lands

4. **Logistics** - Bathrooms, emergency exits, WiFi, schedule
5. **Set Intentions** - Why are we here? What do we hope for?

### Facilitation Tips

**For Discussions:**
- Use talking stick or hand raises (prevent interruptions)
- "Step up, step back" (those talking a lot make space, quiet folks speak up)
- Parking lot for off-topic tangents
- Time box discussions (keeps energy)

**For Q&A:**
- Repeat questions for virtual attendees
- Take questions from chat/virtual first (often ignored)
- Balance multiple questioners (not 5 in a row from same person)
- "Let's hear from someone we haven't heard from yet"

**For Workshops:**
- Hands-on practice > passive listening
- Pair people (learning together)
- Walk around helping (not just teaching from front)
- Celebrate attempts and mistakes

### Code of Conduct Enforcement

**Be Proactive:**
- Review CoC in opening
- Visible reporting process
- Designated responders identified

**If Issues Arise:**
1. Document what happened
2. Talk to reporter privately
3. Talk to reported person privately
