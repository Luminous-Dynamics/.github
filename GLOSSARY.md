# Glossary of Terms

*"In unity we code, in love we debug, in consciousness we deploy"* ✨

A comprehensive guide to terminology used across Luminous Dynamics projects, combining consciousness principles, technical concepts, and gift economy language.

---

## Consciousness & Philosophy

### Byzantine Resistance
The ability of a distributed system to function correctly even when some participants are malicious or faulty. Named after the "Byzantine Generals Problem." Mycelix-Core achieves 100% Byzantine detection.

### CaaS (Coherence as a Service)
Consciousness infrastructure for humanity's awakening. Our organizational mission to provide technology that amplifies collective and individual coherence rather than fragmenting attention.

### Codex / Codex of Relational Harmonics
A library of 87+ documented patterns for conscious system design. Part of the luminous-dynamics monorepo. Provides reusable wisdom for building consciousness-first technology.

### Coherence
State of harmonious alignment between components, beings, or systems. In our context: technology that preserves and amplifies awareness rather than fragmenting it.

### Consciousness-First
Design philosophy that prioritizes preserving and amplifying human awareness over exploiting attention. Core principle of all Luminous Dynamics work.

### ERC (Evolving Resonant Co-creationism)
Our philosophical foundation - a framework for consciousness-first living and human-AI co-evolution based on the Meta-Principle of Infinite Love.

### Field Coherence
Collective state of alignment and resonance within a system or community. The Weave includes Field Visualizer for real-time coherence pattern display.

### Gift Economy / Sacred Reciprocity
Economic model based on voluntary giving and receiving rather than transactional exchange. We operate on these principles rather than extraction-based capitalism.

### Love-Guided Technology
Technology developed with wisdom, compassion, and intention to serve all beings. Implementation of the Meta-Principle in software development.

### Meta-Principle of Infinite Love
Fundamental principle that the universe is a conscious, creative project we all participate in, best served through wisdom-guided love praxis aimed at making everything "better, infinitely."

### Radical Accessibility
Commitment to serve ALL beings equally, removing barriers to participation and benefit. Goes beyond standard accessibility to include economic, cognitive, and philosophical access.

### Regenerative Economics
Economic systems that restore and enhance rather than extract and deplete. Our seven-year transition to community ownership embodies this principle.

### Sacred Development
Writing code with love, wisdom, and intention. Treating development as offering rather than mere work. Considering the consciousness impact of every technical decision.

### Seven-Harmony Architecture
Organizational structure in luminous-dynamics monorepo based on universal principles: resonant coherence, pan-sentient flourishing, evolutionary progression, etc.

## Technical Terms - General

### Agent-Centric Architecture
Design paradigm where each user has their own "agent" (data and processing power) rather than relying on centralized servers. Core to Holochain and Mycelix systems.

### Decentralized / Distributed Systems
Systems with no single point of control or failure. Power and data distributed across participants. Examples: Mycelix ecosystem, Holochain apps.

### End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)
Encryption where only communicating users can read messages. No intermediary (not even the platform) can decrypt. Used in Mycelix Mail.

### Federated Learning
Machine learning approach where model training happens across multiple decentralized devices/servers, each holding local data samples, without exchanging the data itself.

### Holochain
Agent-centric distributed computing framework that puts users in control of their data. Used for Mycelix Mail, Music, Marketplace. Alternative to blockchain that's more scalable and energy-efficient.

### Monorepo
Single repository containing multiple related projects. Our luminous-dynamics repo contains The Weave, Sacred Core API, Field Visualizer, Codex, and more.

### P2P (Peer-to-Peer)
Network where participants interact directly without central intermediaries. Examples: Mycelix Music, Mycelix Marketplace.

### Trust Layer
System for evaluating participant trustworthiness. Our MATL (Mycelix Adaptive Trust Layer) assesses reputation without surveilling content.

### WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2)
Allows running Linux directly on Windows. NSFW uses this to bridge Windows to Nix ecosystem.

---

## Mycelix Ecosystem

### Byzantine Detection
Identifying malicious participants in federated learning. Mycelix-Core achieves 100% detection at 0.7ms latency using the Krum algorithm.

### Krum Algorithm
Aggregation method for federated learning that selects gradients closest to peer consensus, rejecting outliers. Enables our Byzantine resistance.

### MATL (Mycelix Adaptive Trust Layer)
Our reputation-based system for evaluating sender/participant trustworthiness without surveilling data content. Used in Mycelix Mail and Protocol.

### Mycelix Protocol / Mycelix-Core
Production-grade Byzantine-resistant federated learning system. Implements MATL/0TML trust layer with RB-BFT consensus on Holochain.

### RB-BFT (Reputation-Based Byzantine Fault Tolerance)
Consensus mechanism combining Byzantine fault tolerance with reputation scoring. Achieves faster consensus by weighing trusted participants more heavily.

### 0TML (Zero-Trust Machine Learning)
Trust verification approach that validates participant behavior without access to training data content. Acronym: zero-Trust ML.

---

## Energy & Investment

### Energy Democratization
Making renewable energy investment accessible to everyone, not just wealthy investors or institutions. Core mission of Terra Atlas.

### FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission)
US regulatory body for interstate electricity, natural gas, oil. Terra Atlas integrates FERC queue data (11,547+ projects).

### Regenerative Cities
Urban development focused on restoring and enhancing ecosystems while meeting human needs. Terra Lumina's focus area.

### Swiss Foundation Governance
Non-profit foundation structure under Swiss law ensuring mission permanence. Terra Atlas uses this to prevent profit-driven mission drift.

### Seven-Year Transition
Our planned timeline for transitioning from founder-led to full community ownership across projects.

---

## NixOS & Development Tools

### Declarative Configuration
System configuration specified by declaring desired state rather than scripting steps to achieve it. Core NixOS principle.

### Nix
Functional package manager enabling reproducible, declarative system configuration. Foundation of NixOS.

### NixOS
Linux distribution built on Nix package manager. Uniquely reproducible and declarative.

### Nixite
Visual package discovery tool for NixOS. Makes exploring 70,000+ Nix packages accessible through intuitive UI.

### NSFW (Nix Subsystem for Windows)
Bridge bringing Nix's 70,000+ packages to Windows via WSL2. 500-1000× faster package search than standard Nix queries.

### Reproducibility
Ability to exactly recreate system state or build. Nix/NixOS guarantee bit-for-bit identical rebuilds.

---

## Research & Science

### Bayesian Optimization
Statistical technique for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate functions. Kosmic Lab uses this to suggest optimal experiments, reducing needed trials by ~70%.

### Consciousness Research / Consciousness Science
Scientific study of subjective experience, awareness, and phenomenology. Kosmic Lab accelerates this through automation and collaboration.

### K-Codex
Kosmic Lab's system for perfect reproducibility - tracks exact code versions, configuration hashes, random seeds for 99.9% reproducibility with 10-year guarantee.

### Preregistration

## AI & Multi-Agent Systems

### Multi-Agent System
Software architecture with multiple autonomous "agents" that collaborate to achieve goals. The Weave orchestrates AI agents with consciousness awareness.

### Sacred Core API

Governance model where users/contributors collectively own and direct the organization. Our seven-year transition target.

### Gift Circles
Groups practicing gift economy through voluntary giving and receiving. Platform: Infin Love.

### Good First Issue
