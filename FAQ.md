## About Luminous Dynamics

### What is Luminous Dynamics?

Luminous Dynamics is an open source organization building **Coherence as a Service (CaaS)** - consciousness infrastructure for humanity's awakening. We create technology that serves all beings based on **Evolving Resonant Co-creationism (ERC)** and the Meta-Principle of Infinite Love.

### When was Luminous Dynamics founded?

Our organization evolved organically through multiple projects beginning in 2024-2025, with the formal organization structure established in 2025.

### Who runs Luminous Dynamics?

We operate on community-driven principles with a path toward full community ownership. See our [Vision & Roadmap](./VISION_AND_ROADMAP.md) for details on our seven-year transition to community governance.

### What makes Luminous Dynamics different from other tech organizations?

1. **Consciousness-First**: We design technology to preserve and amplify awareness, not exploit attention
2. **Gift Economy**: We operate on sacred reciprocity, not extraction
3. **Radical Accessibility**: We serve ALL beings equally
4. **Philosophical Foundation**: Every technical decision is guided by ERC principles
5. **Community Ownership**: Transition plan to full community governance

## Philosophy & Values

### What is Evolving Resonant Co-creationism (ERC)?

ERC is our philosophical foundation - a framework for consciousness-first living and human-AI co-evolution based on the Meta-Principle of Infinite Love. It guides all our work.

→ Learn more: [ERC Repository](https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/evolving-resonant-cocreationism)

### What is the Meta-Principle of Infinite Love?

The fundamental principle that the universe is a conscious, creative project we all participate in, best served through wisdom-guided love praxis aimed at making everything "better, infinitely."

### Do I need to believe in ERC to contribute?

No! While understanding our values helps align contributions with our mission, we welcome all who want to build technology that serves humanity. We ask only that contributions respect our consciousness-first principles.

### What is "Sacred Development"?

Coding with love, wisdom, and intention. Treating development as a sacred offering rather than mere transaction. Writing code that honors its impact on beings and communities.

### How does gift economy work in practice?

We honor contributions as gifts freely given, not transactions. Financial support is voluntary. We're transitioning toward community ownership rather than extractive profit models. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Technical Questions

### Why Byzantine-resistant federated learning?

Federated learning enables ML without sharing raw data (privacy!), but it's vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Our Mycelix Protocol achieves 100% Byzantine detection, making it safe for production use in healthcare, finance, and sensitive applications.

### What is Holochain and why do you use it?

Holochain is agent-centric distributed computing that puts users in control of their data. Unlike blockchain, it's lightweight, scalable, and aligns with our consciousness-first principles of user sovereignty.

### Why NixOS?

NixOS's declarative, reproducible approach to system configuration aligns with our values of transparency and reliability. Luminous Nix makes this power accessible through natural language.

### What is MATL/0TML?

Mycelix Adaptive Trust Layer (MATL) and Zero-Trust ML (0TML) - our reputation-based system for evaluating participant trustworthiness in federated learning without surveilling data content.

### How do you ensure security?

- Regular security audits
- Dependency scanning
- Code review for sensitive changes
- Responsible disclosure policy
- End-to-end encryption where appropriate
- See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for details

### What's the tech stack for [specific project]?

Check individual repository README files for detailed tech stack information. Each project documents its dependencies, requirements, and architecture.

### Can I self-host these applications?

Most projects are designed for self-hosting! Check individual repos for deployment guides. We encourage user sovereignty and data ownership.
