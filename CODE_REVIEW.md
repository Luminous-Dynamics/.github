## 🎯 Code Review Philosophy

### Purpose of Code Review

Code review is **not** about:
- ❌ Gatekeeping or asserting authority
- ❌ Finding every possible flaw
- ❌ Enforcing personal preferences
- ❌ Slowing down development

Code review **is** about:
- ✅ **Knowledge sharing** - Learning flows both directions
- ✅ **Quality improvement** - Catching bugs and design issues
- ✅ **Collective ownership** - Everyone understands the codebase
- ✅ **Mentorship** - Growing skills and judgment
- ✅ **Consistency** - Maintaining coherent patterns

### Core Principles

1. **Generous with Praise, Specific with Critique**
   - Highlight good work explicitly
   - Feedback should be actionable and clear
   - Balance: 3+ positive comments for every critical one

2. **Assume Competence and Good Intent**
   - Author made thoughtful choices (even if different than yours)
   - Ask questions before asserting problems
   - "What led you to this approach?" vs "This is wrong"

3. **Review as Learning Opportunity**
   - Reviewers learn from new approaches
   - Authors learn from feedback and questions
   - Everyone learns from discussion

4. **Focus on What Matters**
   - Correctness > Performance > Style
   - Security issues are never nitpicks
   - Code style can be automated (linters)

5. **Respect Time and Energy**
   - Respond within expected timeframes (see [COMMUNICATION.md](./COMMUNICATION.md))
   - Be thorough, but don't perfect the already-good
   - Ship iteratively, not perfectly

**Label Guide:**
- 🔴 **Priority 1 (Critical)**: Security, logic errors, data integrity - MUST FIX
- 🟡 **Priority 2 (Important)**: Design, performance, breaking changes - SHOULD FIX
- 🟢 **Priority 3 (Suggestion)**: Style, optimizations, improvements - NICE TO HAVE

---

### Priority 1: Correctness & Security

**Critical Issues (Must Fix):**

1. **Logic Errors**
   ```python
   # ❌ Off-by-one error
   for i in range(len(participants) - 1):  # Misses last participant!
       process(participants[i])

   # ✅ Correct
   for participant in participants:
       process(participant)
   ```

2. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   ```javascript
   // ❌ SQL injection risk
   const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;

   // ✅ Parameterized query
   const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?';
   db.query(query, [userId]);
   ```

3. **Error Handling**
   ```python
   # ❌ Silent failure
   try:
       result = risky_operation()
   except:
       pass  # Data loss, no visibility!

   # ✅ Explicit handling
   try:
       result = risky_operation()
   except SpecificError as e:
       logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
       return error_response("Operation unavailable", retry=True)
   ```

4. **Data Integrity**
   - Race conditions
   - Unchecked null/undefined access
   - Missing validation
   - Incorrect state transitions

### Priority 2: Design & Architecture

**Important Issues (Should Fix):**

1. **API Design**
   ```python
   # ⚠️ Unclear API
   def process(d, t=None, f=False):
       pass

   # ✅ Clear API
   def process_federation_data(
       data: FederationData,
       trust_threshold: float = 0.3,
       force_revalidation: bool = False
   ) -> ProcessedData:
       """Process federation data with optional trust validation."""
       pass
   ```

2. **Abstraction Level**
   - Functions doing too much (split them)
   - Premature optimization (YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It)
   - Missing abstractions (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself)

3. **Code Organization**
   - Files in correct location
   - Logical grouping of related code
   - Clear module boundaries

4. **Performance Issues**
   - N+1 query problems
   - Unnecessary computation in loops
   - Memory leaks or unbounded growth

### Priority 3: Readability & Maintainability

**Nice to Have (Suggest if Significant):**

1. **Naming**
   ```python
   # ⚠️ Unclear
   def calc(p, t):
       return sum(x.v for x in p if x.s > t)

   # ✅ Clear
   def calculate_byzantine_resistance(
       participants: List[Participant],
       trust_threshold: float
   ) -> float:
       return sum(
           p.voting_weight
           for p in participants
           if p.trust_score > trust_threshold
       )
   ```

2. **Comments**
   - Complex logic needs explanation (why, not what)
   - Public APIs need documentation
   - TODOs should have context and issue numbers

3. **Code Structure**
   - Deeply nested conditionals (refactor for clarity)
   - Long functions (consider breaking up)
   - Duplicated code (extract to function)

### Priority 4: Style & Formatting

**Automated (Don't Spend Time On):**

- Indentation, spacing, line length
- Import ordering
- Trailing whitespace

**Use linters and formatters:**
- Python: `black`, `ruff`, `mypy`
- JavaScript/TypeScript: `prettier`, `eslint`
- Rust: `rustfmt`, `clippy`

**In Review:**
```markdown
nitpick: Consider running `black` to format this file consistently.
```

Don't spend time manually pointing out style issues that tooling can catch.

## 💬 How to Give Feedback

### Feedback Tone

**Use Conventional Comments:**

Format: `<label>: <comment>`

**Labels:**
- **praise:** Highlight good work
- **suggestion:** Propose improvement (not required)
- **question:** Seek clarification
- **issue:** Problem that should be addressed
- **nitpick:** Minor style preference (non-blocking)
- **thought:** General musing, not requiring action
- **todo:** Specifically for TODOs in code

**Examples:**

```markdown
**praise:** Love the comprehensive error handling here. The error messages
are really helpful for debugging.

**suggestion:** Consider extracting this validation logic into a separate
function for reusability:

    def validate_trust_score(score: float) -> None:
        if not 0 <= score <= 1:
            raise ValueError(f"Trust score must be 0-1, got {score}")

**question:** How does this behave when `participants` is empty? Should we
return 0 or raise an error?

**issue:** This could lead to a SQL injection vulnerability. We should use
parameterized queries instead:

    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", (user_id,))

**nitpick:** Variable name `d` could be more descriptive (`duration`?).
Not blocking, just a thought.

**thought:** This might be a good candidate for the strategy pattern if we
add more trust algorithms in the future. Worth considering but not for this PR.
```

### Specific Over General

❌ **Vague:**
```
This function is too complex.
```

✅ **Specific:**
```
**suggestion:** This function handles three distinct concerns: validation,
transformation, and persistence. Consider splitting into:

1. `validate_federation_data(data)`
2. `transform_to_internal_format(data)`
3. `persist_federation(data)`

This would make each function easier to test and understand.
```

### Ask Questions, Don't Demand

❌ **Demanding:**
```
Change this to use async/await instead of promises.
```

✅ **Questioning:**
```
**question:** What's the reasoning for using promise chains here instead of
async/await? Async/await would be more readable, but maybe there's a
performance or compatibility consideration I'm missing?
```

### Suggest, Don't Prescribe

❌ **Prescriptive:**
```
You must refactor this to use the factory pattern.
```

✅ **Suggestive:**
```
**suggestion:** This might be a good use case for the factory pattern, which
would make it easier to add new participant types later. Something like:

    class ParticipantFactory:
        @staticmethod
        def create(participant_type, data):
            if participant_type == "node":
                return NodeParticipant(data)
            elif participant_type == "client":
                return ClientParticipant(data)

Thoughts? Happy to discuss alternatives.
```

### Balance Positive and Critical

For every critical comment, try to include 3+ positive ones:

```markdown
**praise:** The test coverage here is excellent. I especially appreciate the
edge case tests for empty input and null values.

**question:** Should we also test the behavior when trust_threshold > 1?

**praise:** Good use of type hints—makes the function signature very clear.

**suggestion:** Consider adding a docstring with an example:

    def calculate_resistance(participants, threshold):
        """Calculate Byzantine resistance score.

        Example:
            >>> participants = [Participant(trust=0.8), Participant(trust=0.2)]
            >>> calculate_resistance(participants, threshold=0.5)
            0.8
        """

**praise:** The error handling is thorough and the error messages are helpful.
Nice work!
```

## 🙋 How to Receive Feedback

### For PR Authors

**1. Assume Good Intent**
   - Reviewers want to help, not hinder
   - Questions are opportunities to clarify, not criticisms
   - Different perspectives strengthen the work

**2. Respond to All Comments**
   - Even if just "Done" or "Good catch!"
   - Explain reasoning if you disagree
   - Ask for clarification if confused

**3. Distinguish Required from Optional**
   - **issue**: Should be addressed
   - **suggestion**: Consider, but your call
   - **nitpick**: Feel free to ignore
   - **question**: Needs response, not necessarily code change

**4. It's Okay to Disagree**

✅ **Respectful Disagreement:**
```markdown
I understand the concern about performance, but I benchmarked both approaches
and they're within 5% of each other. Given the readability benefits of this
approach, I'd prefer to keep it unless we see performance issues in production.

Thoughts?
```

❌ **Dismissive:**
```markdown
Premature optimization. I'm keeping it as is.
```

**5. When Overwhelmed**

```markdown
Thanks for the thorough review! There's a lot of feedback here. To make sure
I address everything:

Required changes (I'll do these):
- Fix the SQL injection issue
- Add error handling for empty input
- Update tests for edge cases

Suggestions I'm adopting:
- Extract validation to separate function
- Add docstring with example

Suggestions I'm holding off on (for now):
- Refactor to factory pattern - I'd like to ship this first, then refactor in
  a follow-up PR. Opened #567 to track.

Does that sound reasonable?
```

**6. Request Re-Review**

After making changes:
```markdown
@reviewer I've addressed all the feedback:
- Fixed SQL injection (commit abc123)
- Added error handling (commit def456)
- Extracted validation function (commit ghi789)

Ready for another look!
```

## 🤝 Special Review Situations

### Large PRs (>500 lines)

**For Authors:**
- Consider breaking into smaller PRs
- If must be large, provide detailed guidance for reviewers
- Highlight areas needing careful review

**For Reviewers:**
- Review in multiple sessions (avoid fatigue)
- Start with high-level architecture, then details
- Okay to request split if too large

### Urgent PRs (Hotfixes)

**Expedited Review (Same Day):**
- Security patches
- Critical bug fixes
- Production outages

**Process:**
- Label with `priority: urgent`
- Ping reviewers directly
- Reduced scope review (correctness + security only)
- Detailed review can happen post-merge

### Refactoring PRs

**Additional Checks:**
- [ ] Behavior unchanged (tests prove it)
- [ ] Incremental approach (not rewriting everything)
- [ ] Clear improvement (not just "different")

### Controversial Changes

**When Reviewers Disagree:**
1. Discussion in PR comments (try to reach consensus)
2. If no consensus, escalate to Sacred Council (see [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md))
3. Document decision in [ADR](./ADR.md)

**When Author and Reviewer Disagree:**
1. Discuss and try to understand perspectives
2. Involve a third reviewer
3. If technical disagreement, bias toward author's approach (they did the work)
4. If values/security disagreement, bias toward reviewer's concerns

---

## 🎓 Review Skills Development

### For New Reviewers

**Start Small:**
- Review documentation and small bug fixes first
- Shadow experienced reviewers (read their reviews)
- Ask questions when uncertain

**Learn by Doing:**
- Mistakes are okay (another reviewer will catch them)
- Request feedback on your reviews
- Iterate and improve

**Resources:**
- [How to Do Code Reviews Like a Human](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/)
- [Code Review Best Practices](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/)
- Our [STYLE_GUIDE.md](./STYLE_GUIDE.md) for doc reviews

### Common New Reviewer Mistakes

❌ **Being Too Nice:**
```
Looks good! 👍
```
*Missing obvious bugs to avoid conflict*

✅ **Be Kind AND Thorough:**
```
**praise:** The overall approach looks great.

**issue:** This could cause a null pointer exception on line 45 if
`participant` is undefined. Let's add a null check:

    if (!participant) {
        throw new Error("Participant required");
    }
```

---

❌ **Being Too Harsh:**
```
This is terrible. Rewrite it.
```

✅ **Be Constructive:**
```
**suggestion:** This approach might be challenging to maintain as complexity
grows. Consider using the adapter pattern, which would make it easier to add
new data sources:

[code example]

Happy to discuss alternatives that achieve the same goals.
```

---

❌ **Focusing on Style:**
```
Line 23: missing space after comma
Line 45: inconsistent indentation
Line 67: should use single quotes
```

✅ **Automate Style:**
```
**nitpick:** Consider running `prettier` to handle formatting automatically.
```

### Continuous Improvement

**Regular Retrospectives:**
- How's our review process working?
- Are reviews timely?
- Are they helpful?
- What could improve?

**Metrics to Track:**
- Review turnaround time
- Number of review cycles per PR
- Bugs caught in review vs production

**Celebrate Good Reviews:**
- Highlight excellent reviews in team meetings
- Thank reviewers publicly
- Recognize teaching and mentorship

---

## 🚫 Code Review Anti-Patterns

### For Reviewers

❌ **Bike-Shedding:**
Spending excessive time on trivial details while missing serious issues.

```
The important architectural flaw is overlooked, but we spend 20 comments
debating whether to call it "data" or "information"
```

---

❌ **Design by Committee:**
Every reviewer has a different suggestion, pulling in different directions.

**Solution:** Author should drive decisions. Reviewers suggest, author decides.

---

❌ **Rubber Stamping:**
Approving without actually reviewing.

```
LGTM 👍
[Posted 30 seconds after PR opened with 500 lines changed]
```

---

❌ **Gatekeeping:**
Using review power to assert dominance or enforce preferences.

```
I won't approve this unless you use MY preferred pattern, even though both
approaches are valid.
```

---

❌ **Moving Goalposts:**
Requesting changes, then requesting different changes after those are made.

**Solution:** Do complete first review. All feedback upfront.

### For Authors

❌ **Defensive Responses:**
```
You just don't understand the requirements.
```

**Better:**
```
Let me clarify the requirements. The spec says [X], which is why I implemented
it this way. Does that make sense, or should we discuss the spec?
```

---

❌ **Ignoring Feedback:**
Marking "Done" without making changes or explaining why not.

---

❌ **Over-Explaining:**
10-paragraph justifications for every decision.

**Balance:** Explain *why* when non-obvious. Don't need to defend every choice.

---

## 💚 Code Review as Sacred Practice

### Consciousness-First Principles in Review

1. **Growth Over Perfection**
   - Every coder is learning
   - Mistakes are opportunities
   - Ship and iterate > Wait for perfect

2. **Care for People**
   - Remember: there's a human behind every PR
   - Tone matters (text is colder than you think)
   - Be generous with appreciation

3. **Collective Intelligence**
   - Many perspectives make better code
   - Author's context + reviewer's fresh eyes = better solution
   - We all make each other better

4. **Sustainable Pace**
   - Reviews shouldn't cause burnout
   - It's okay to say "I don't have capacity right now"
   - Marathon, not sprint

### Review as Service

Good code review is a **gift**:
- Reviewer gifts time and expertise
- Author gifts the work and receptivity to feedback
- Both gift the community with better code

Approach with gratitude:

**From Authors:**
```
Thank you for the thorough review @reviewer! The suggestion about error
handling is really helpful.
```

**From Reviewers:**
```
Thank you for this contribution @author! Really appreciate the comprehensive
tests and clear documentation.
```
