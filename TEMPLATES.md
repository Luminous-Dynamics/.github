*Last updated: January 2025*

This document provides **copy-paste templates** for common tasks in the Luminous Dynamics community. Use these to save time while maintaining consistency and quality. Adapt freely—templates are starting points, not straitjackets.

## 🎯 How to Use These Templates

1. **Copy the template** that matches your need
2. **Fill in the bracketed [placeholders]**
3. **Delete sections** that don't apply
4. **Add sections** specific to your context
5. **Remove this meta-commentary** before posting

**Remember**: These templates embody our consciousness-first values. If you find yourself fighting against a template, listen to that—templates serve you, not the reverse.

## 🎨 Template Customization Tips

### Make Them Your Own

**Add your voice**:
- These templates are consciousness-first but generic
- Inject your project's personality
- Use examples from your actual work

**Simplify ruthlessly**:
- If a section never gets filled out, delete it
- Templates should save time, not create busywork

**Evolve them**:
- As your project grows, templates should too
- Quarterly review: What's working? What's friction?

**Provide examples**:
- The best templates include real examples
- Link to well-done instances of each template in use

### Creating New Templates

When you find yourself doing something repeatedly:

1. **Document the pattern** you're using
2. **Generalize it** - what's specific vs. reusable?
3. **Add placeholders** for variable content
4. **Test it** - have someone else use the template
5. **Iterate** based on feedback
6. **Add to this doc** via PR!

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

**For template users**:
- Don't fill in every section if it's not relevant—delete extras
- Adapt language to your situation
- Templates are training wheels—eventually you won't need them

**For template maintainers**:
- Include examples of good usage
- Provide both verbose and minimal versions
- Make placeholders obvious with [brackets] or ALL_CAPS
- Test with newcomers—they'll find the confusing parts
